x = 8
y = x / 2
x = x * y
z = x - y * 5
vec = [1,4,3,8]
A = vec(3)
A = A + vec(4) / vec (2)
newvec = y : z : x
vec(1) = newvec(2)
vec(2:4) = [x,y,A]

a. I am a freshman in Electrical and Computer Engineering!
b. I am learning C concurrently in ECEN 1310 and have done a little programming on Arduinos, but otherwise I have no programming experience.
c. I am beyond excited to learn MATLAB and more about programming in general. I also have already taken Differential Equations so I am interested to learn how to put DiffEq terms into something a computer can understand and break down!
